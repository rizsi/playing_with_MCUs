= Measure pin change interrupt reaction time and execution time on ATTiny25

The program generates a constant signal that is visible on an oscilloscope.

An external signal generates an interrupt. During interrupt the signal is not working so we can se how long the execution of the interrupt takes.

Results:
 * Execution of main program stops: 4 cycles are executed before interrupt breaks execution of main program
 * __vector_2 (.org 0x0002) executes: 3 additional cycles to enter ISR 4th cycle is ISR entry command
 * reti: 4 cycles - as written in datasheet
